Written Report for Week 4 Challenge – Elizabeth Perez SilvaIn this challenge, I was tasked with analyzing the district-wide standardized test results of different schools. Through the execution of code, that was provided in the starter code and that I learned in class, I found that we had to analyze the reading scores and math scores of 39170 students from 15 different schools. I processed multiple Data Frame’s using the data from the csv files provided. This included a district summary, performance-based school summaries, grade-based summaries, school spending and budget summaries. In these summaries, the data I gathered was displayed in an organized table, such as groupings, total counts, averages, and percentage calculations.From my calculations, I was able to conclude that Huang High School had the highest budget per student at $655 , but did not have the highest average scores out of all the schools. I was also able to conclude that Cabrera High School had the highest overall passing rate at 91.334769% which was calculated by using the students passing math and reading and per school count calculations. The school with the lowest overall passing rate was Rodriguez High School with 52.988247%.
